Are you curious about the location of a mobile number? Maybe you want to track a lost phone or keep tabs on your child's whereabouts. Whatever your reason, you can use Python to find the location of a mobile number.

In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to track a mobile number's location using Python. You'll need some Python coding skills and access to a few geolocation libraries. Let's get started!

To make this project only you need to follow this step:-








## Installation

Install package with pip

```bash
  pip install phonenumbers
  pip install folium
  pip install geocoder
  pip install opencage
```

Now need to collect Geocoder API Key from https://opencagedata.com/

Step1: Need to log in or sign up

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
import phonenumbers
from phonenumbers import geocoder
from phonenumbers import carrier
import opencage
from opencage.geocoder import OpenCageGeocode
import folium


key = "your key" #Geocoder API Key need to paste here "your key" 
number = input("please giver your number: ")
new_number = phonenumbers.parse(number)
location = geocoder.description_for_number(new_number, "en")
print(location)

service_name = carrier.name_for_number(new_number,"en")
print(service_name)

geocoder = OpenCageGeocode(key)
query = str(location)
result = geocoder.geocode(query)
#print(result)

lat = result[0]['geometry']['lat']
lng = result[0]['geometry']['lng']

print(lat,lng)

my_map = folium.Map(location=[lat,lng], zoom_start=9)
folium.Marker([lat, lng], popup= location).add_to(my_map)

my_map.save("location.html")

print("location tracking completed")
print("Thank you")
